Hey there,

So, here's how the Damon Family Columbus Day Weekend Soccer Extravaganza works out. 

Sat:
8:00 - Epping, NH - Owen
8:00 - Nashua, NH - Ollie
10:20 - Epping, NH - Owen
1:00 - Nashua, NH - Ollie

Sun:
8:00 - Epping, NH - Owen
12:00 - Nashua, NH - Ollie
12:40 - Epping, NH - Owen (if they did well enough in the bracket to play the final)

We have a party in town on Saturday night that we're planing on going to. Owen and Ollie are going to a friends house where there is a group babysitter, since other parents are going to this same party. 

Let me know what works for you guys.
