1. Confirm - Apparel specialty includes all Core and Core + from the previous workbooks
2. Confirm - Summit, Steep, and Flight are only the repective series. Not the uber book for that type of dealer.
3. Run Specialty - The RS book is everything that RS dealers need per the segmentation sheet? Core MC Sportswear? 
4. What workbook has the "Urban Vanguard" from Snowsports? This is ok product for Lifestyle specialty, but they are generally exluded from the Snow Specialty book.
