Hey there,

So, I've gone through the updated workbook file from Pat, and rebuilt it in my format for the team. 

I need to tighten a few more things and then I'll put it up on Solve. 

Here are the differences that I found: (double asterisk ** are what I'm going to send to Pat)

** TNF Retail Partners cannot get the Running Specialty book - this excludes them from Isotherm, Ambition, and BTN, and is counter to the matrix.
** Outdoor Specialty cannot buy from the Running Specialty book - this excludes them from Isotherm, Ambition, and BTN, and is counter to the matrix.
* Outdoor Specialty T3 cannot buy from the Snow Specialty book
** Outdoor Lifestyle cannot buy from the Running Specialty book - this excludes them from Isotherm, Ambition, and BTN, and is counter to the matrix.
** Outdoor Lifestyle T2 cannot buy from the Flight book - this is counter to the matrix. We have a few of these dealers, but I think they'd all self select out of the product anyway. 

CAPE TIP SPORTS INC
CARL DURFEE INC
COUNTRY WOOLENS INC
H E SHAWS CO INC
WILD FLOWERS BOUTIQUE LLC

* Ski Specialty T3 cannot buy from the Snow Specialty book
* Footwear Specialty can get the Cryos book. (that I should've had in the first file)
* Footwear Chain can get the Cryos book. (that I should've had in the first file)
** Run Specialty does not get the Footwear book - this is counter to the matrix. 
** Run Specialty does not have access to accessories - this is counter to the matrix. Mike mentioned this to Terri at the sales meeting and is going to follow up with Pat for the B2B part. Accessories is important to Run Specialty accounts. We're thier best line. 
* Run Specialty does not get the Flight Series book
** Lifestyle does not get the footwear book - this is counter to the matrix
** Lifestyle T3 is listed as getting a Cryos workbook - this is counter to the matrix

Other notes:
* Technically run specialty is not supposed to get the Flight book since all the styles are double listed in the Run Specialty book. However, the flight book is the glossy showpiece, and should be something that we give to those dealers to build excitement.
