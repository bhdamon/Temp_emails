Notes from Kerri on EMS Equipment Shop:

Thanks for understanding.  I had some time this morning to look through the information I had on hand and attached are images from the recent Post st retail renovation.  I pulled all of the images with the tents featured on the platforms.  It looks like the platforms were custom built based on the footprint of the tent.  So you can use your assortment recommendation as a base for square footage.  I also don't have any costs related to this but for 2 doors I'd estimate $10K for a custom build.

Equipment Fixture assumptions: 
3,200 each
another $1K since the quantities are lower and we allow for any unexpected costs. 
Rough footprint: 71"W x 48"D x 72"H

My fixture capacity estimate from reviewing the pictures: 
Sleeping bags: 15 units on one end. SBs are displayed on one side, three display units. 
Tents: 9 units on one end. 
Tech Packs: Six arms, four units per arm, so 24 units total.
