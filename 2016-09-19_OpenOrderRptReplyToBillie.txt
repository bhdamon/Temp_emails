Hi Billie, 

Thanks for sending. 

Of the $2.3m on hold, the bulk of it is two accounts, Bob's Chalet and Trailblazer. 

Bob's Chalet has 35 palletts shipping this week - about $500k. Once that goes out Bob's Chalet is up against their credit limit. If we can increase his line, Bill Gonsalves will take more product.

The Trailblazer buyer has been on vacation for the last two weeks, back in the office today. We hope to have some visiblity on what she wants to release tomorrow or Wednesday. 

We'll continue to work this week to ship everything that we can. 

Thanks,

Ben
