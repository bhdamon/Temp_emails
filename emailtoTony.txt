Hi Tony, 

I hope you have a great weekend on tap!

I have a left field question for you. 

Mark made a quiet comment to Christine and and I that Troy is moving on soon to a new opportunity. 

Once you are at the point where you are ready to start a search, I'd like to apply. I can bring skills to the table that complement and deepen your current team, as well as ramp up much quickly than a candidate from outside the family, especially if you would like to get someone on board before the F17 sales meeting. 

I am not looking for other opportunities outside of the agency right now, but as I thought about your team and all the balls in the air this seemed like an opportunity that would only come around once.

The challenge, and this is my question, is that I am not in a position to relocate at the moment. My mother's health is in a tough spot, and moving her grandchildren to the west coast it something that I can't do right now.

My estimate is that the role would take about 50% travel, and that is something I'd committ to. 

Given that limitation, would you like me to apply?

If it comes to interviewing, then I'll be completely up front with Mark. He's great that way. But if it doesn't make sense because you have to have a local candidate then I'd rather not put him through the stress with no purpose. 

I'd be more than happy to talk this through on the phone today or next week if that would help give you more context. 

Thanks very much, 

Ben
