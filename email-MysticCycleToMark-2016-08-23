Hi Mark,

So I talked to Sharon about Mystic Cycle Center. 

PO 16128REPLACE  is on hold because when Marty from MSC called in to place the PO he asked the CSR to hold it. 

Sharon looked back into the order records and they've been placing small at once orders on a regular basis. 

Aug 15th - the PO in question 7 pcs
May 2016 - Two POs for 2 and 3 units
Nov 2016 - 5 units
Sept 2015 - 4 units
July 2015 - 4 units
June 2015 - 4 units
... no more records after that due to the Acadia switchover

Given this, my inclination is to ask them to preline F17, subject to the 2k minimum per category, in Hollis or Worcester. If that is somthing that Rob feels they cannot do, then management will request that the account be placed in inactive status and unable to order. 

If you want me to be more agressive and place the account into inactive status now, shipping the current PO if they want it, and starting up the new account process with Jacob, I can do that no problem. Just let me know. I'll be in the office until 6 or so. 

Thanks,

B
