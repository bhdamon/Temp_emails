Hi Francois, Tony and Jacob, 

I hope you are all having a great week in South America!

Attached is the proposal deck for the Technial Equipment shops that were a followup from OR. 

At this time we have talked about the overall concept with EMS management, but have not shared this level of detail with the category manager or buyer. 

A few notes:

* ATS is tight on the proposed styles/colors, but there is enough to work with at this time. 
* There is one slide that is waiting on ST data from the Post St renovation.

Please let us know your thoughts and the best next step forward. 

Thanks very much, and don't let Jacob get you into too much trouble each night.  

Ben
