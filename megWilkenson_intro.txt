Hi Meg, 

I'm glad to hear from you! It would be great to get on a call to see what we can add to any current and future plans that you might have. 

We've never met, but I think I already owe you an apology. It popped up in my email client that you sent me a note on March 3d that I missed in a post-vacation deluge. Thanks for reaching out in spite of that!

Let me round up with a few folks to see what might work out from a timing standpoint. Cassie Cullen in my office works on the EMS account as well and is point for marketing issues. Christine Davidson is our territory marketing manager, and she has the details of what TNF is doing from a brand standpoint. 

My guess is Thursday or Friday morning sometime, but I'll give you a range, and if it doesn't work for you then we can certainly bounce this into next week.  

Thanks,

Ben
