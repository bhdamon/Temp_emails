Hey there, 

One more note as I'm going through the Apex Flex template. 

On the S17 Apex Flex Orders tab Egon Zimmerman's Sport Chalet is listed as "Boutique Specialty", when the other TNF Retail Partners are listed as "Partnership Specialty"

Where did Boutique Specialty come from? I didn't see it on the Segmentation Matrix sheet from 8/24. Not a big deal, but I'm curious.  

Thanks,

B
