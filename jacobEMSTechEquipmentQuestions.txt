Hi Jacob,

1. Yes, the gondola cost is roughly accurate. We spec'd this with Kerri last year for a Sport Chalet Homestead presentation that obviously never happened. The open question is the cost of the tent platform.

2. Yes, we would reserve the product. Once you and EMS management are all on board I'd hammer out the actual buy with the category buyer. EMS would transmit the initial floor set as a PO, and we'd put the flows on a bulk. Based on sales every two weeks the buyer would transmit a pull from that bulk. The idea is that AOI would be communicating what should be pulled, and EMS is entering and transmitting the order without much back and forth.

3. We recommend holding this program to a S16 launch for three reasons.

     a) You are correct about the lead time on the fixtures. Without the fixtures, we lose the visual power of the shop, probably impacting consumer sales. One of the risks here is shop performance. Unless the shop shows successful sales in the first three months, EMS management might not follow through with the two or three years of participation that gives the initial TNF fixture investment a full ROI.

     b) I looked at F16 ATS against this assortment, and in my opinion it would be a challenge to fill the shop.  All the tech packs would need to RA two months after they hit the floor to make room for new S17 colors, and tent/bag ATS is quite limited.

     c) The ability of EMS to ship their full F16 apparel order-book as written based on the 2m combined VFO credit line is an open question. It could be a challenge to ship/refresh this shop on time with POs going on/off hold at unpredictable moments.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

B
