Hi Jacob and Mark, 

Art Shinner, the owner of AJ's Ski and Sport, our largest dealer in Stowe, is requesting a terms change. 

Currently he has 10 invoices totalling $50,829 that are at 6%NJan10. 

He would like to pay these this week at 10%N30. All are current until 10/1 if we make the switch. 

Shawn has been clear with Art that VF does not have an anticipation program, but that we'd see what we could do. 
Can we submit the program sheets to make this change, or does Art need to pay the invoces as written at 6%?

If you need any additional info, let me know. 

Thanks very much, 

B
