Hi Kristy, 

I hope you had a great weekend!

A few housekeeping things for you. 

* I gave Julio a check to cover Oct on the 24th
* We owe you paperwork. We were at class today, and I forgot to ask Seth about it. 
* We're going to take advantage of the Wednesday 4:30 kids class this week - 5th - and the third week - 19th.

Any questions, let me know. 

Thanks,

Ben
