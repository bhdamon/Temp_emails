Hi Tom!

I was better last week when it was colder! Hopefully you saw the TNF sales bump like the chain did overall. 

Yes, Mike did mention the hike meetup event to me. We rounded up on it yesterday evening. 

As it stands, the TNF apparel assortment that you have in store is heavy on lifestyle product, and short on styles that will help a winter hike consumer. I don't think that we'd add much to the event. 

That said, we certainly can support you with some schwag.
