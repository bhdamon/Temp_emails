Hey there,

It's F16 Cap Rock 1/4 time.

My apologies on this one - I'm behind the eight ball on getting this info out to you AND we are likely oversold AND Miles is out of the country. 

Can you please fill in what you have POs for? We'll then huddle up to prioritize as needed, or if we do then you can start pulling from the bulk for your dealers. 

Thanks for the patience. 

Ben
