Hi Jacob, 

As I was working on the workbook forcast last week, a few segmentation questions popped up. 

1. It looks from the style list that the Jerry collection and the Pendleton collection have footwear styles included as an element of both collections. As near as I can tell from the 8/24 Segmentation Matrix, both Footwear Chain and Footwear Specialty are excluded from buying these shoes. Jerry is explicit since it looks like Jerry = Cali Roots, and Pendleton implicit as there is no "Specialty Exclusives" row within Footwear.

2. Less important is that Lifestyle Specialty cannoty buy Cali Roots. This could be by design. 

Thanks,

Ben
