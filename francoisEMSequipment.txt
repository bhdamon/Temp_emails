Hi Francois,

I hope you are having a good week!

I am putting the finishing touches on our proposal for S17 Technical Equipment shops in EMS doors. As you and Mark talked about at GTM, we're baseing the design on the TNF retail Post St renovation that is performing so well.

What I'm missing at this point are some Post St stats to help validate the concept.  

Can you point me in the direction of Who should I talk to to get some TY vs LY statistics on how the redesigned Equipment department is lifting sales?

Thanks very much,

Ben
