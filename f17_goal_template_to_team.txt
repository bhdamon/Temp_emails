Hi Everyone, 

It's F17 Goal Forecast time!

Attached is the usual goal forecst file, and well as some un-usual support files. 

1. Workbook list - this is prelim, but it's the easiest way to see what you can and can't sell to an account. The key thing to keep in mind is that the Outdoor Specialty book is the big book for dealers who can buy pretty much anything. The Core + book includes Core for the second tranche of dealers, and Core contains only Core products, so is the most restrictive. 
2. Line list with segmentation - use this in combination with the workbook file when you have questions about what can and can't sell to a dealer/channel.
3. COB style var with the new goal categories added in.
4. Goal file

As in past seasons, please do not add/remove rows or sort the data. You can go to town with the filters. 

Please return the filled out goal file to me by Wednesday, 9/21. One file per person. Please also check the door counts tab and correct as needed. 

Any questions or problems, and there should be - this is complicated, please let me know. 

Thanks,

Ben
