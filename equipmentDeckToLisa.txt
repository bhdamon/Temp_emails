Hi Lisa and Nancy, 

I hope you are both having a great week. 

Attached is our proposal for TNF Technical Equipment shops in three of your doors. 

The core concept is to replicate the success with equipment that the TNF Post St store has seen following the recent renovation.

The numbers that you see in this deck are estimates, but should be close to the real costs.
